Training a large neural network pipeline involves three main steps:
1. Preparing the data
2. Write the architecture
3. Write the productivity


But, we'll start by developing the GPT-3 architecture.

this video will seperate to three video, even i seperate any fashion, all content finally same

first: write model architecture, initialize weight
second: we will first skip data prepare, this part to end, will start write forward part 1
three: forward part 2
four: backward initialize weight, backward part 1

1.Introduction to the GPT-3 Model Architecture

In this part, we will describe the general architecture of GPT-3 (or a GPT-like model).
This will include key components such as:
Transformer architecture (self-attention layers, multi-head attention, etc.)
Positional encodings
Layer normalization
Feed-forward neural networks
2.Step 1: Initializing Weights and Building the Model

We will begin by initializing the model's parameters (weights), which is crucial for building a neural network.
This will involve defining the layers and components of the transformer block.
We’ll show how to initialize weights for the attention layers, feed-forward networks, and layer normalization.
3.Step 2: Forward Pass (Part 1)

In this section, we will start with the forward pass, covering the first part of the process:
Input tokenization and embedding layers
Passing embeddings through the transformer blocks (without yet computing the final output)
Attention mechanism and multi-head attention in the first part of the network
4.Step 3: Forward Pass (Part 2)

In this section, we’ll continue with the second part of the forward pass:
Completing the feed-forward network and computing the logits (predictions)
Output processing (softmax, logits to probabilities)
5.Step 4: Backward Pass (Part 1)

After we have completed the forward pass, we will move on to the backward pass (backpropagation).
This step includes:
Calculating the loss function (e.g., cross-entropy loss)
Computing the gradients for each layer using backpropagation
